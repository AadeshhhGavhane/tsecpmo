### I. INTRODUCTION
TODAY'S mobile devices are multi-functional devices capable of hosting a broad range of applications for both business and consumer use. Like a computer operating system, a mobile operating system is the software platform that determines the functions and features available on your device, such as thumbwheel, keyboards, wireless security, and synchronization, messaging and more. Some of the more common and well-known Mobile operating systems are Google’s Android and Apple’s IOS because of their Popularity we are going to talk about these two operating systems which are commonly seen in market and then compare them with each other.

### 1.1. Smartphone’s
A Smartphone is a mobile phone build on a mobile operating system with more advanced computing capability and connectivity than a phone. The first Smartphone’s combined the functions of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with a mobile phone. Some other features,
- Portable media players,
- Compact digital cameras,
- Pocket video cameras,
- GPS navigation,
- Web browsers,
- Touchscreen,
- Wi-Fi,
- Mobile Broadband.

### 1.2. Smartphone’s OS
There are many Operating Systems for smart phones. The main mobile operating systems (OS) used by modern smart phones includes the following:
- Google's Android,
- Apple's iOS,
- Nokia's Symbian,
- RIM's BlackBerry OS,
- Microsoft's Windows Phone.
Such operating systems can be installed on many different phone models, and typically each device can receive multiple OS software updates over its lifetime.

### 1.3. Android
Android, Inc. was founded by Andy Rubin. In 2005, Google acquired it and then the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Finally, On the November 5, 2007 the Open Handset Alliance, a business alliance of several companies which include Google, HTC, Intel, LG and other 76 firms unveiled itself. On the same day, the Open Handset Alliance also unveiled their first product, Android, a mobile device platform which was built on the Linux kernel version 2.6.

### 1.4. IOS
iOS is Apple`s mobile operating system. Originally developed for the iphone, iOS now can also support other Apple`s devices such as itouch, ipad and Apple TV. Although it is derived from Mac OS X, iOS has the technologies that are  available only on  itself,  such  as  the  Multi-Touch interface   and    accelerometer   support,   and    these  devices make iphone easier to use.

## 3. Exhaustive Chart and Figure Explanation

### Figure 1: iPhone and Apple
The figure shows the iPhone and Apple logo, indicating the brand and device being discussed.

### Figure 2: Internal Architecture and Working
The diagram shows the components of the Android OS. One of its most well known features is the applications (apps). Applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit, but other development tools are available, including a Native Development Kit for applications or extensions in C or C++.

### Figure 3: Android Architecture
The Android architecture has several layers as showed in Figure 3.
- **Kernel**: Linux   is   support    for   core   system   services   such  as  security,  memory  management,  process  management, network stack, and driver model. The kernel also acts as an abstraction layer between the hardware and the rest of the software stack.
- **Runtime**: Runtime includes core libraries and Dalvik virtual machine. Core libraries have a set of core libraries that provides most of the functionality available in the core libraries of the Java programming language. Every Android application runs in its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine. The Dalvik VM executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is optimized for minimal memory footprint. The VM is register-based, and runs classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into the .dex format by the included “dx” tool. The Dalvik VM relies on the Linux kernel for underlying functionality such as threading and low-level memory management.
- **Libraries**: Android has a set of C/C++ libraries used by various components of the Android system. These libraries are exposed to developers. The system C library is a BSD-derived implementation of the standard C system library. The media libraries are based on PacketVideo’s openCORE which support playback and recording of many popular audio formats. The surface manager manages access to the display subsystem and seamlessly composites 2D and 3D graphic layers from multiple applications.

## 4. Unified Full Context Narrative

The document provides a comprehensive comparison of Android and iOS, two of the most popular mobile operating systems. Android, developed by Google, and iOS, developed by Apple, have been competing in the market for years. The document discusses their architecture, features, and market share.

Android's architecture consists of several layers, including the Linux kernel, runtime, libraries, and application framework. The Linux kernel provides core system services such as security, memory management, and process management. The runtime includes core libraries and the Dalvik virtual machine, which executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format.

iOS, on the other hand, has a different architecture. It consists of a hardware layer, firmware layer, processor layer, iPhone OS layer, Objective-C runtime layer, frameworks/API layer, and application layer. The iPhone OS layer includes the kernel, drivers, and services that comprise the iPhone Operating System.

The document also discusses the features of Android and iOS, including their development environments, performance, and security. Android provides a customized Java virtual machine and Java byte code interpreter, making it a Java platform. iOS, on the other hand, uses Objective-C language and has a closed, proprietary system.

In terms of market share, Android and iOS are the top two mobile operating systems worldwide. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, Android and iOS combined for 91.1% of all Smartphone shipments during the fourth quarter of 2012. Android continued its overall upward trajectory, reaching triple-digit growth for the year. iOS posted yet another quarter and year of double-digit growth with strong demand for the iPhone.
