### inter-school sports day (november 14)

on november 14, the school hosted an inter-school sports day with three nearby kindergartens. kindergarten a participated in sprint races, relay races, a mini-football match, and tug-of-war.

most students were visibly excited throughout the day. 20 out of 22 students participated in at least one event.

during the mini-football match, kindergarten a scored three goals and won the game 3–1. after goals were scored, some students ran along the sidelines celebrating loudly.

during the same match, a disagreement over a foul occurred between students. this led to pushing and shouting involving two students from kindergarten a and one student from another school. teachers intervened and separated the children.

after the relay race, two students from kindergarten a argued over who deserved the medal more. the argument escalated into hitting and crying before adults stepped in.

some students who did not win their events cried and refused to take part in later activities. a few made negative comments toward classmates who won medals.

two students became very upset when told there were no extra medals available and tore their participation ribbons.

there were minor injuries during the sports day:

* one student fell while running near the field and scraped their knee
* another student was pushed while lining up for tug-of-war and hit their elbow on the ground

first aid was given on site. no hospital visits were required. incident reports were completed, and parents were informed.

### classroom behavior during november

compared to october, more behavioral incidents were observed this month. incidents included pushing, shouting, grabbing toys, and refusing to follow instructions.

many conflicts occurred during free play and transition times such as cleaning up, lining up, or moving between activities.

a small group of students appeared repeatedly in incident logs. these students often became frustrated quickly and reacted physically during disagreements.

during circle time, students were able to explain classroom rules such as “kind hands” and “using words instead of hands.” when guided by an adult, several students could explain how they felt using phrases like “i am angry because…”

however, in the moment, many students struggled to pause and apply these rules without adult prompting. conflicts often escalated quickly from verbal disagreement to physical actions.

due to time constraints, not every incident was followed by a full discussion about what happened and how to repair the situation.

### health and safety incidents

six health and safety incidents were recorded in november. three occurred during sports day activities. two occurred on the playground when students fell from low climbing equipment. one occurred in the classroom when a student leaned back on a chair and tipped over.

all incidents were minor. first aid procedures were followed in each case. parents were informed on the same day.

fire and evacuation drills were conducted during the month. all students participated, and the class completed the drills more quickly than in previous months.

### classroom activities and learning focus

during november, classroom activities focused on learning about emotions, the body, and working as a team.

students participated in activities using feeling cards and stories to identify different emotions. many students were able to correctly name emotions shown in pictures or described in stories.

group art activities were conducted, including making a team flag for sports day. most students participated in these activities, though some students tended to take control while quieter students participated less unless invited by the teacher.

while students could name emotions during activities, several still reacted to frustration by shouting, hitting, or withdrawing rather than choosing calmer responses.

### parent interactions

many parents attended the sports day event. several expressed happiness and pride about the class winning trophies and participating enthusiastically.

after the event, some parents raised concerns about the visible fights, crying, and minor injuries. a few parents mentioned that their children talked at home about disliking losing or not wanting to play if they could not win.

parents were informed about injuries and incidents on the same day they occurred.
